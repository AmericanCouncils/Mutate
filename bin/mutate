Note that this script will check for classes in the top-level adapter/presets/jobs directories provided with the library.  If any classes are found
in those directories, they will automatically be registered.  By default these directories are empty, they're simply there as a convenient place to put
code when the library is being used in a stand-alone manner.

If those directories aren't present, then only the adapters/presets/jobs provided with the library will be registered.

To see how to properly specify classes in those directories, see the README.md file in the root of this library.
